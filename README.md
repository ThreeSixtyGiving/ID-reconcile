#ID-reconcile
ID-Reconcile is a 360Giving project which will help to reconcile recipient orgnsiation organisational ID.

Currently, charitirs have more than one organisational id (charity or comapny number for example), or can have no id at all. 
This proejct will allow to identify entities to reduce duplications of recipient organisations and will allow data publishers to 
identify their recpients in a consistent way.
