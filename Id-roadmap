What do we want this product to do?
1. Will reconcile current enitties in the 360Giving dataset
2. Will help data publishers to find current internal 360Giving org ids for organisations.
3. Will help data publishers to enrich their dataset with org-ids.

Who is the main audience?
1. Staff in grantmaking organisations that published 360Giving with usually low capacity to analyse the data, either because they don't have
the knowledge or the time to produce one.
2. Data analysts who want to reconcile 360Giving data.

How we will achieve this?
1. We will reconcile the current 360Giving corpus using de-dupe algorithm.
2. We will create a query tool for identifiers using the reconciled data.

Version 1.0 MVP -
